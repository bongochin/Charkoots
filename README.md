One of my favorite hobbies is to entertain my friends and family. I love everything about it; the planning, preparing, presenting... watching people share laughters, making new acquaintances  and having a great old time. But, anyone who ever hosted anybody would agree that "great old time" requires work. A lot of work.

<strong>Charkoots </strong>*(/ˌSHärˈko͞ots/)* is my answer. All you have to do is to simply select and customize a charcuterie board, and the perfect wine that compliments the board will be paired automatically.

This project continues my theme of materializing a solution for things I feel passionate about.  This app has its focus on minimizing the time and effort that goes into hosting and entertaining, so everyone can truly focus on what's important -- Having a great old time.

### Board Items

Each item selected on your Charkoot Board has a taste profile, broken down to 5 core components: Boldness, Sharpness, Saltiness, Spiciness, Sweetness. User can view the statistics of each menu items on Menu tab.

### Wine Pairing

After the selection has been completed, our algorithm will take averages of each components and recommend the perfect wine to compliment the board.
